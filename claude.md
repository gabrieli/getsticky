When doing code reviews, use `create_review` to put the review on the canvas for user feedback, then `get_review_summary` to read back their comments and decisions.

For automated testing, see [getsticky-app/TESTING.md](getsticky-app/TESTING.md). All MCP-based test suites are documented there for verifying the data model and MCP integration.
